Welcome to Goomble Gurt 2!

Go on a brand new Goomble filled adventure and maybe make a few friends along the way!

Controls: 
Everything can be done with mouse/touch input. 
Optional Features for Desktop:
- Using keyboard to nickname Goombles
- Arrow keys to navigate comics

P.S. Easy Mode can be toggled in the settings menu.


About Saves:
Saving on mobile is a bit tricky since it isn't easy to copy text from a list. Try using "select all" and then editing the paste to remove all the extra words you copy, or if your phone allows for raindrop selection to make sure the right raindrop is past the "..." before you copy. On desktop, simply triple click the text in the save code to select it all. Try to store your save somewhere like a .txt or .csv, as certain software can add markers to the text that corrupt the data.
